### stuff i made
i made [lovetale](https://github.com/sawby08/lovetale), an undertale battle engine made in love2d!
<br>i also coded and made music for my friend's game, [from now on](https://gamejolt.com/games/korekara/1004770)!

that's the only big thing, though. everything else on my page are smaller projects that i put less time into. feel free to have a look around, though!
